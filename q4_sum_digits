#Program: Summing the digits in an integer
#By: David Fan

#Request user for integer between 0 to 1000
integer = input("Hello! Input an integer between 0 to 1000: ")
#Variable to sum up the digits
sum_of_numbers = 0

#Variable: i is the position of the number
i = 0
#len(integer) = length of integer. Length max 4. Position max 3(0, 1, 2, 3)
while i < len(integer):    
  sum_of_numbers = sum_of_numbers + int(integer[i])
  i = i + 1
#Display answer
print(sum_of_numbers)
